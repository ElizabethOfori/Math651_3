Third try is the charm.

This is a third attempt to figure out the workflow for Git and Github.
Three words to look up in the glossary are Branch, Clone, and Fork.

Note that the master files all live "in the cloud" on the Github server, that we access through the web.
When collaborating, if you want to make changes, you should create a "branch" which is like a copy of the files,
that you can play with and change at will. (Without affecting the master files). Then you make a "pull" request
to the system, so the owner guy (HEAD?) can decide whether to merge your changes from your branch back into the master files.

We also want to work locally (on our own computer) on these files. Create a branch, then clone it to get files onto your computer disk. Do all your editting on your own computer, then "sync" your files to get your branch "on the cloud" updated. Now your branch is updated, but no one else knows about it. So you make a "pull" request, to ask the owner to update everything onto the master files.

I don't see why you can't use the "cloud" repository directly from the computer. You can make little edits from the browser (on github.com) but that seems pretty limited. 

Anyhow, let's try this out.
